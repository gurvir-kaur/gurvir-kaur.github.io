      <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">INTERNET CONNECTION and WEB 
SOCKET</h3>
         <p>  Internet connection is just point to point connection of two 
points on the Internet, full duplex connection data flows in both the directions 
after the connection has been established. It is reliable. 
          <br>
          Socket, it's just an end, end to the point to point connection, so for 
an internet connection we need two sockets, one on the client side and the other 
on the server,
          <br>
          Breaking down the sockets in two parts, they are IP address and port 
number for example client socket can be 123.76.87.8:9898, so on the left of 
colon is the IP address of the client and on the right side is a port number.
          <br>

          <aside style="float: right; width: 50%;">
          <b>What are port numbers?</b>
          <br>
         For client side these can be randomly assigned by the OS (The Ephemeral 
Port), but for server side for example youtube.com:80, port number 80 is 
standard port number for all of the web traffic.
         <br>

         <br>
         <br><br><br><br>
         
         <p>
           <b>So why does client have random port number but the server side has 
80?</b> 
         <br>
         Because the server side has to be more reliable and available for all 
the time.

and also asks DNS to resolve domain names.</li>

        <ol>
            <li>Resource gathering- webpages, using networking model, html, pics 
to get what we need to display.</li>
            <li>Parse HTML and create DOM TREE- document object model, its 
official thing regulated by W3, so in this step we take all that data from step 
one and create a tree of DOM objects.</li>
            <li>Create render tree from DOM tree- it hides the things which are 
not to be seen from html code so a DOM tree is converted to the render tree of 
what actually needs to be seen. Puts all the stylings of CSS and html to the 
effect.</li>
            <li>Layout - position the rendered tree and give them size.</li>
            <li>Painting - taking all the info and sending to UI backend to 
actually draw on the monitor.</li>

        <p>Core UI gets to the OS to use the draw function. Handle z axis, over

          <ol>
            <li>Follows client/server model or request/response model, so the 
browser we use is the client to the protocol and the web applications like 
YouTube or Facebook are servers, that are sitting on the cloud on the 
internet.</li>
            <li>It is stateless protocol. Means every transaction is independent 
of the other. Even though http is stateless we get the functionality of the 
states through other things such as cookies or sessions.</li>
            <li>It is an application layer, sits above transportation layer, it 
uses TCP as its transport level protocol. TCP defines how data is 
transmitted.</li>
            <li>Client action, whenever client request something from server 
always specify action, like GET (read only, get a page or resource) /POST 
(creating something new) /DELETE.</li>
            <li>Server status code, define response static codes that the server 
makes to client. 200 ok, 404 not found.</li>
            <li>Headers, tiny bits of custom info that are sent along with the 
request and with responses to pull the operation of request, for example one 
header that can be included on the request header side is content type. Response 
header can be cache control, optimization technique of internet and determines 
how different resources are cached by all the different clients. There is no 
rulebook for headers, these can be custom to a particular website.</li>

        <h2>Session & Cookies</h2>
        <p style="width: 59%; float:right;">
          Cookies are something which is a function of state and that is a part 
of client side (browser) and session is related to the web server, web 
client(browser): server ∷ we: Starbucks ∷ cookies: session.
          <br>
          Cookies are always client side and can actually be seen from the 
browser for all the diff website.
          <br>
          Every single http request sent by our browser carry a cookie with it 
so that the server can do something smart with it. Http is originally a 
stateless protocol but sessions and cookies make it state full.
          <br>
          Cookies are always client side but session is mostly server side but 
sometimes sessions are also stored on the client side, that makes it real fast 
but there is lack OS space.

        <h2 style="color: white; text-align: center;">Security</h2>

        <p style="background-color: #efeeee; padding: 2%;">
          Asset can be anything like hardware, software or data. The perceived 
value of an asset depends upon the ease with which the asset can be replaced.
          <br>
          One of the major goal of information security is to reduce the 
security risks but along with it also to protect the valuable assets.
          <br>
          To study methods of assets protection, we use a 
vulnerability-threat-control framework.
          <br>
         Vulnerability is a weakness in the system, and can be exploited to 
cause harm or loss.
         <br>
         Threat, a set of circumstances that has the potential to cause harm or 
loss. Control, an action, device, or procedure that eliminates or reduce a 
vulnerability. Threats are blocked by controlling vulnerability!
         <br>
        CIA= the security triad, so the threats can be thought to interfering 
with CIA of an information system.
        <br>
        Confidentiality - the ability of a system to ensure that assets are 
viewable only by authorized parties.
        <br>
        Integrity - the ability of a system to ensure that assets are modified 
only by the authorized parties.
        <br>
        Availability - the ability of a system to ensure that assets are only 
usable and assessable by authorized parties.
        <br>
        Aside from CIA other system properties include :
        <br>
       Authentication - the ability of a system to confirm the identity of a 
sender.
       <br>
       Nonrepudiation - property of a system in which the sender can't 
convincingly deny having sent a message.
       <br>
       Auditability - ability of a system to trace all actions related to a 
given asset.

        </p>
      </section>

      <section id ="section_8">
        <h2>Harmful Acts</h2>
        <p>harm to a system can be caused by 4 different ways-</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Interception - intercept valuable information flowing over a 
network.</li>
          <li>Interruption-  disrupt the information systems ability to carry 
out its tasks.</li>
          <li>Modification - modify system or modify its information assets 
without being properly authorized to do so.</li>
          <li>Fabrication - fabricate new identity or asset to cause harm to the 
system as a whole.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Each of the above acts are harmful acts and can affect the system's 
ability to ensure CIA.</p>
        <p>For an attack to be successful attackers need MOM!</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Method- skill knowledge tool with which to attempt an attack.</li>
          <li>Opportunity - time and access to attempt an attack.</li>
          <li>Motive - a reason to attempt an attack.</li>

        </ol>
        <p>If any one of three is eliminated, attack will not be successful</p>
      </section>

      <section id="section_9">
        <h2>Method of Defence</h2>
        <p>Six approaches to defend our system-</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Prevent attack- block attack/close vulnerability.</li>
          <li>Deter attack- make attack harder if not fully prevented.</li>
          <li>Deflect attack- make another target more attractive than this 
target.</li>
          <li>Mitigate attack- make the impact of attack less severe.</li>
          <li>Detect attack- during or after (also important, we can learn and 
recover from attack).</li>
          <li>Recover from attack- backup copies of data or organizational 
protocols that allow us to quickly recover from successful attack.</li>
        </ol>
